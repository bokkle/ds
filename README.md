Project Name - Coin Info Frontend
This is the frontend for a cryptocurrency coin project. Please note that this is not a real coin (yet) and is purely a prototype or conceptual representation. The project aims to showcase the frontend interface that will be used for managing and interacting with the coin, but the actual backend and coin functionalities have not been implemented yet.

About
This project is built using React and Vite for rapid development with fast hot module reloading (HMR). The frontend interacts with mock data and serves as a starting point for building out a full cryptocurrency experience in the future.

Features
3D hero model: Tracks and looks at user cursor.
Contract Address Display: A section displaying the contract address for the coin, with a copy-to-clipboard functionality.
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern user experience.
Current Status
The coin information displayed is for conceptual purposes only.
Backend and blockchain integration are not yet implemented.
Currently focusing on building the frontend UI and preparing for backend integration when the coin goes live.
